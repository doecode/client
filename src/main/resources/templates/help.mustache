        <p>
            Yes, an account is needed to submit or announce scientific and business software to DOE CODE. Users meeting minimum criteria can directly create a DOE CODE account. 
            Your first and last name, government email address or valid contract number, and a password are required. 
            From the top right of any DOE CODE page, you may register for an account by clicking <a href='/${app_name}/register'>Create Account</a> 
            (or <a href='/${app_name}/login'>Sign In</a> if you already have an account).

        <p>
            Individual software records are directly submitted by the developer or the developing organization.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            DOE CODE offers two paths for users to provide code. Users can (1) <strong>submit</strong> code to DOE CODE, 
            and (2) <strong>announce</strong> code to the Department of Energy for official review and release through DOE CODE. 
            <strong>Submitting</strong> software offers increased discoverability and the option to obtain a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for the code, 
            while <strong>Announcing</strong> software ensures announcement and dissemination in accordance with DOE statutory responsibilities. 
            See the FAQs on submitting <a href='/${app_name}/faq#what-does-it-mean-to-submit'>scientific</a> and <a href='/${app_name}/faq#what-does-it-mean-to-submit-business-software-to-doe-code'>business</a> software

                <h3 class='static'>Make Version</h3>
                <strong>New or Previous Versions of Software</strong> - DOE CODE also has the option to create a DOE CODE record that is a newer or previous version of any DOE CODE record already submitted or announced.  
                Selecting either of the Make Version buttons, "New" or "Prev," associated with a record will take you to the entry form with most of the metadata fields 
                already filled. You can also use this option to submit a tagged release of your code by entering the specific URL to the tagged release in 
                GitHub (ex. <a href="https://github.com/doecode/server/releases/tag/v2.0.1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/doecode/server/releases/tag/v2.0.1</a>). 
                The Version Number field will autopopulate with the tagged release number, but can still be edited if desired. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Once you have submitted or announced your "New" or "Prev" record, DOE CODE will automatically add metadata to all newer/previous records 
                to reflect the appropriate relationship using the related Identifier fields.

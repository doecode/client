                    DOE CODE is the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) new software services platform and search tool for software resulting from DOE-funded research 
                    that provides functionality for collaboration, archiving, and discovery of scientific and business software funded by DOE. DOE CODE replaces the 
                    Energy Science and Technology Software Center (ESTSC). DOE CODE is an open source project and is available on GitHub. Throughout these FAQs, the 
                    terms "software" and "code" are used interchangeably, though it is understood there are discrete definitions in various communities.

                    DOE CODE tool is a platform that provides for the submission and search of software resulting from DOE-funded projects.

                    The DOE CODE GitHub Community is a repository option available to DOE-funded developers. This community is open to registered users of DOE CODE, 
                    and those users are welcome to create and import their own repositories once they join. This service is provided by OSTI in recognition of the fact 
                    that many developers prefer to house and manage their projects on GitHub. DOE CODE is an open source project and is also available on GitHub.

                    Yes. DOE CODE provides repository hosting services for the DOE community via <a title="DOE CODE Github" target='_blank' rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/doecode/doecode">GitHub</a>
                    and <a title="Gitlab" target='_blank' rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://gitlab.osti.gov/users/sign_in">GitLab</a>. GitHub repository services are for those who want typical GitHub open
                    source project functionality. OSTI's GitLab repository service offers the same functionality as the GitHub repository service, but allows for open or closed repositories for unlimited
                    availability software and more control of the code.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    If you are interested in making use of the GitHub or GitLab repository services and would like to request to join the DOE CODE GitHub community, please fill out the <a href='/${app_name}/gitlab-signup' title='DOE CODE Gitlab Signup Form'>request
                        form</a>. For any questions about the repository services, contact <a title="Email doecoderepositories@osti.gov" href="mailto:doecoderepositories@osti.gov">doecoderepositories@osti.gov</a>.

                    The current version of DOE CODE is designed to support submission and announcement of DOE-funded unlimited availability software (including closed source, proprietary software). Announcement and
                    discovery of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI), including DOE Official Use Only (OUO) and Export Controlled Information (ECI), are not included in the current version of DOE CODE. Please
                    continue to utilize Announcement Notice 241.4 for submission of limited availability software.

                    The source code is required (or compiled binary as a last resort when the code is not available), and a landing page URL is optional for submitting 
                    Closed Source, OSTI Hosted code. A private GitLab repository will be automatically created using the uploaded resource and a Repository Link will be 
                    generated automatically with which OSTI will distribute the code/software. If interested, you may request an OSTI GitLab account

                    The source code is required (1) when submitting or announcing codes with Project Type CS-OH and (2) for announcing codes with Project Types OS-NPAR 
                    and CS-SH.  For the first Project Type, CS-OH, compiled binary may be provided as a last resort when the code is not available.  
                    For Project Type, CS-OH, the source code is required because the system takes the uploaded file and automatically creates a GitLab 
                    repository for the project, and adds the Repository Link back into the record for the user. For Project Types OS-NPAR and CS-SH, 
                    the code is required for preservation purposes only; i.e., not for distribution by OSTI. (See also

                        Individual software records and associated metadata are directly provided by the developer or the developing organization to DOE
                        through DOE CODE. When an individual software record is associated with a DOE National Laboratory, the laboratory POCs will be notified

                        When providing software and code to DOE CODE, users will first need to identify what type of software they are
                        submitting - scientific or business software. Users who are unsure of the type of software are encouraged to please work with
                        their site's Dissemination Authority.

                        In cases where a repository link from which OSTI can access and archive software is not available, the software itself should be submitted to OSTI along with associated metadata.
                        For submission of limited availability software, please continue to utilize Announcement Notice 241.4 via <a href='https://www.osti.gov/elink/' title='E-Link' target='_blank' rel="noopener noreferrer">E-Link</a>.
                        Future versions of DOE CODE will address submission of

                    <p>
                        DOE CODE offers two paths for users to provide scientific software. Users can (1) submit code to DOE CODE, and (2) announce code
                        to the Department of Energy for official review and release through DOE CODE. For more information about submitting and announcing
                        code, see the

                        Users may want to simply submit their scientific software to DOE CODE because submitting offers increased discoverability and the
                        option to obtain a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for the code, making it more easily citable and shared. Submitting scientific
                        code to DOE CODE is easy, with only a minimal set of metadata required. The primary use case for this functionality includes codes
                        that are in early development and for developers wanting to obtain DOIs early in the process.

                        To efficiently fulfill Departmental requirements to maintain an inventory of all DOE-funded custom-developed software and to report 
                        this inventory to the government-wide Code.gov website, metadata for all scientific and non-scientific (e.g., business) software should 
                        be submitted to DOE CODE. This inventory will foster scientific progress, provide transparency to and promote public uptake of DOE-funded 
                        open source software (OSS), and enable DOE to fulfill requirements for government-wide reporting of custom-developed software to Code.gov.

                        Users may want to simply submit their business code to DOE CODE. Submitting offers increased discoverability and the option to obtain a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) 
                        for the code, making it more easily citable and shared. Submitting business code to DOE CODE is easy, with only a minimal set of metadata required. 
                        The primary use case for this functionality includes codes that are in early development and for developers wanting to obtain DOIs early in the process.

                        Yes. DOE CODE has the option to create a DOE CODE record that is a newer or previous version of any DOE CODE record you have already 
                        submitted or announced.  You can see this functionality by logging in to your DOE CODE account, and looking on the “Manage My Projects” page. 
                        Selecting either of the Make Version buttons, "New" or "Prev," associated with a record will take you to the entry form with most of the 
                        metadata fields already filled.  Once you have submitted or announced your "New" or "Prev" record, DOE CODE will automatically add metadata 
                        to all newer/previous records to reflect the appropriate relationship using the related Identifier fields.

                        Yes.  To ensure long-term preservation of DOE-funded scientific and technical information (including software), OSTI employs dark archiving 
                        practices as a Departmental backup and storage area to house the working copy of software resources. (See also

                    DOE CODE search works much like a basic Google search, where you can enter your terms into the basic search box to retrieve results. 
                    You can search for a single term or a phrase by putting it in "double quotes." Additionally, DOE CODE supports Boolean and proximity 
                    operators, wildcards, and parentheses for grouping:
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <div style="padding-left: 40px;">
                        <strong>Boolean Operators</strong>
                        <br />
                        DOE CODE recognizes the operators AND, OR, and NOT.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Example: A search for <strong>algorithm AND "quantum simulator"</strong> will return results that include both the term <strong>algorithm</strong> and the phrase <strong>quantum simulator</strong>.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Example: A search for <strong>algorithm OR "quantum simulator"</strong> will return results that include either the term <strong>algorithm</strong> or the phrase <strong>quantum simulator</strong>.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Example: A search for <strong>algorithm NOT "quantum simulator"</strong> will return results that include the term <strong>algorithm</strong> but not the phrase <strong>quantum simulator</strong>.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        + and - allow for a search to either be required or forbidden in the search results.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Example: A search for <strong>simulation +algorithm</strong> will return results that include the term <strong>simulation</strong> and also include the term <strong>algorithm</strong>.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Example: A search for <strong>simulation -algorithm</strong> will return results that include the term <strong>simulation</strong> but not the term <strong>algorithm</strong>.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <strong>Proximity Operators</strong>
                        <br />
                        Example: <strong>"quantum simulator"~3</strong> will return results where <strong>quantum</strong> and <strong>simulator</strong> are within three words of each other in the bibliographic record.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <strong>Parentheses for Grouping</strong>
                        <br />
                        Example: A search for <strong>algorithm AND ("quantum simulator" OR energy)</strong> will return results that include both the term <strong>algorithm</strong> and either the phrase <strong>quantum simulator</strong> or the term <strong>energy</strong>.

            DOE CODE is the software services platform and search tool that allows for scientific and business software to be provided to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). 
            The DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (DOE OSTI) developed DOE CODE, providing functionality for collaboration, archiving, 
            and discovery of scientific and business software. DOE OSTI is charged with fulfilling the Department's responsibilities to collect, preserve, 
            and disseminate scientific and technical information (STI), including software, emanating from DOE research and development activities.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to DOE OSTI's charge for scientific software, the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) and DOE OSTI partnered to leverage DOE CODE 
            to maintain a comprehensive inventory of DOE-funded custom-developed business software. In accordance with the Office of Management and Budget Memorandum M-16-21, 
            <cite>Federal Source Code Policy: Achieving Efficiency, Transparency, and Innovation through Reusable and Open Source Software</cite>, 
            DOE CODE fulfills requirements to maintain an inventory of all DOE-funded custom-developed software and to report this inventory to the government-wide Code.gov 
            website.

        <h3 class='static'>Scientific and Business Software</h3>
        <p>
            DOE-funded scientific and business software are collected by DOE CODE. Software records within DOE CODE provide software details and links to the software itself, 
            a code repository, or project contact information for access to the software. The repositories may also include manuals, examples, and test data.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            When providing software and code to DOE CODE, users need to identify what type of software they are submitting—scientific or business software. 
            Users who are unsure of the type of software are encouraged to please work with 
            their site's <a href='https://www.osti.gov/stip/about/stip-community#SoftwareContacts' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Software Point of Contact</a>.

        <h3 class='static'>Providing Software to DOE</h3>
        <p>
            Software records should be provided directly to DOE CODE either by a developer or the developing organization. DOE CODE offers two paths for users to provide 
            scientific code. Users can (1) submit code to DOE CODE to make the software discoverable and optionally assign a DOI, and (2) formally announce code to DOE 
            complying with DOE funding responsibilities. 
        </p>
        <a href='submitting-software-to-doe-code'></a>
        <h4 class='static'>Submitting Software to DOE CODE</h4>
        <p>
            Users can submit their code to DOE CODE. The submission process is for code in early stages of development, which can be shared with unlimited distribution, 
            and for those wanting to obtain a DOI early in the process. Software that has limited distribution (OUO, CUI, etc.) 
            and an access limitation cannot be provided via the submission process; that software must go through the DOE CODE announcement process. 
            Only a minimal set of metadata is required for submission to DOE CODE (details on required metadata are below).

        <h4 class='static'>Announcing Software to DOE through DOE CODE</h4>
        <p>
            Users may need to announce their code to DOE to ensure announcement and dissemination in accordance with DOE statutory responsibilities, 
            complying with DOE funding responsibilities. The announcement process is for code in later stages of development that have gone through internal 
            review and release processes. The DOE CODE announcement process requires additional basic metadata above the submission process 
            (details on required metadata are below).

            <br/>
            To efficiently fulfill Departmental requirements to maintain an inventory of all DOE-funded custom-developed software and to report this 
            inventory to the government-wide Code.gov website, metadata for all scientific and non-scientific (e.g., business) software should be 
            submitted to DOE CODE. This inventory will foster scientific progress, provide transparency to and promote public uptake of DOE-funded 
            open source software (OSS), and enable DOE to fulfill requirements for government-wide reporting of custom-developed software to Code.gov.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            DOE CODE offers two paths for users to provide business software. Users can (1) Submit code to DOE CODE, and (2) Announce code to the 
            Department of Energy for official review and release through DOE CODE.  (See <a title="Help" href="help">Help</a> for information about

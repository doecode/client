		    <em>Information Collected: Web Measurement and Tracking</em>
	       </strong>
	       <p>This site employs the use of two separate types of cookies, session and persistent, to collect non-personal information related to how users traverse the website. A cookie is a small file that a website transfers to your computer to allow the retrieval of specific information about your session while you are connected to a website.</p>
	       <ul>
		    <li>
			 <p>
			      <u>Session cookies</u>&nbsp;last only as long as your browser is open; once the browser is closed the cookie disappears.</p>
		    </li>
		    <li>
			 <p>
			      <u>Persistent cookies</u>&nbsp;will remain on your hard drive until it reaches its expiration date or is deleted by you. This type of cookie is stored on your computer so the website that placed it there can recognize and remember when you return visit and keep track of which pages on their website you visit.</p>

	       </ul>
	       <p>The federal government has&nbsp;

The goals of the guidelines are to enable the useful functioning of federal websites while protecting individual privacy.</p>
	       <p>This site does not automatically collect or store personal information in identifiable form about users. Certain non-personally identifiable information is collected and stored automatically via session cookies, including:</p>
	       <ul>
		    <li>
			 <p>the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the domain from which you access the Internet (i.e., 123.456.789.012), whether yours individually or provided as a proxy by your Internet Service Provider (ISP);</p>
		    </li>

			 <p>the date and time you accessed the site;</p>

It is not shared with anyone beyond the professional support staff of this site, except when required by Law Enforcement investigation, and is used only as a source of anonymous statistical information.</p>
	       <p>The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) classifies the use of this type of technology as Tier 1 usage, since we are utilizing a single session web measurement technology that does not collect any personally identifiable information (PII).</p>
	       <p>This site may also use session cookies to provide salient session-related information and to enable product-specific functions not related to web measurement and tracking. In no case will cookies be used to capture information that might compromise or threaten personal privacy.</p>

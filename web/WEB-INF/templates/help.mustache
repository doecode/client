	  <br/>
	  <br/>
	  <p>Individual software records are directly submitted by the developer or the developing organization.
	       <br/>
	       <br/>DOE CODE offers two paths for users to provide code. Users can (1)&nbsp;<strong>submit</strong>&nbsp;code to DOE CODE, and (2)&nbsp;
	       <strong>announce</strong>&nbsp;code to the Department of Energy for official review and release through DOE CODE. See the "
	       <a title="What does it mean to submit code to DOE CODE?" href="faq#what-does-it-mean-to-submit">What does it mean to submit code to DOE CODE?</a>" and "
